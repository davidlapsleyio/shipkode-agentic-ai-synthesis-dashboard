# De-duplicated Competitive Intelligence Dashboard

As an Opportunity Hunter, I want a de-duplicated view of competitor activities so that I can maintain an accurate intelligence dashboard without 'AI fatigue' or redundant reading.

## Actors

- The Opportunity Hunter (Senior PM)
- The Architectural Strategist (Principal AI Architect)

## Preconditions

- The 10 key competitors are defined in the user settings.

## Main Flow

1. The user logs into the web dashboard.
2. The system displays the 'Unified Intelligence Feed' which consolidates 10+ newsletters.
3. The user filters the feed by 'Competitor Mentions'.
4. The system presents a singular, synthesized update on a specific competitor's move, citing 4 different news sources.
5. The user exports the summary for the executive leadership team.

## Postconditions

- The competitive intelligence dashboard is updated with the latest 10 competitor activities.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The dashboard prevents any duplicate article summaries.
- The 'Competitive Intelligence' widget updates in under 5 minutes from data ingestion.
- Users can export the summary to a PDF or Slack-ready text format.
