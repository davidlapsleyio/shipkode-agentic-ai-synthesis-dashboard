# Cross-Source Framework Synthesis

As an Architectural Strategist, I want to view a synthesized comparison of competing Agentic frameworks based on community technical critiques so that I can reduce my research time from 90 minutes to 20 minutes.

## Actors

- Architectural Strategist (Principal AI Architect)

## Preconditions

- System has indexed the last 12 hours of Hacker News and 10+ tech blogs.

## Main Flow

1. The user selects 'Compare Frameworks' from the dashboard.
2. The user inputs specific keywords 'LangGraph' and 'CrewAI'.
3. The system aggregates 24 hours of technical discussions and blog reviews.
4. The AI engine extracts 5 distinct performance benchmarks and technical limitations reported by users.
5. The system generates a side-by-side comparison table showing stability and developer sentiment scores.

## Postconditions

- The Architect has a 300-word synthesis ready for the CTO brief.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The summary condenses 200+ comments into 5 or fewer technical themes.
- The comparison includes at least 3 specific benchmark metrics (e.g., latency, token cost, success rate).
- Selection of sources includes both primary Hacker News threads and at least 2 associated technical blog posts.
